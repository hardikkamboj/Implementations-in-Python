| Sr. Number.   | Project Name                           |  Description  | 
|---------------|----------------------------------------|---------------| 
| 1 | [Hidden Markov Models](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/Implementations-in-Python/tree/main/Statistics%20and%20Probablity/Hidden%20Markov%20model%20(HMM))      | Using HMM for guessing tomorrow's weather. I also wrote an article on it, which exapnds more into philosophy, you can check the article [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hardik-kamboj_math-hmm-python-activity-6961592395318669312-UzYa?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)| | |
| 2 | [Confidence Intervals for Simpler Models](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/Code/tree/master/Confidence_interval_for_simple_models) | Visualizing Confidence Intervels for Linear Models |
| 3 | [Confidence Intervals using Bootstraping](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/Code/tree/master/Confidence_intervals_using_boorstraping) |Visualizing Confidence Intervels for polynomial models  |
| 4 | [Monty Hall problem](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/Code/tree/master/Probability) | Implementation of the famous [Monty Hall Problem](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-monty-hall-problem/) |
| 5 | [Running Stimulations with Python](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/Code/tree/master/Probability) | Finding probability of a given problem using stimulations. Includes a visualization which shows that the probability calculated by trials equals the expected probability as the number of trials are increased. | 
| 6 | [Zipf's law](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/Code/tree/master/Zipf%20law) | Visualizing the Zipfs' distribution for a large text corpus|
| 7 | [HMM GUI](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/hmm_gui) | GUI for the HMM application|
| 8 | [Stats and probability notes by Khan Academy](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/Statistics-and-Probability-Khan-Academy) | Notes for the Probability and Statistics course by Khan Academy|
